# dfs-tictac-toy.py
* An implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe
 * in python, with an artificial intelligence using
 * depth first search.

this project is a toc_tac toy with to player you and the computer how use depth first search (dfs) to determ the the suteble game 

Depth-first search is an algorithm that traverses a tree depth-first, meaning that it traverses the tree recursively,
exhausting one branch completely before continuing to the next one.

This form of game AI is amongst the easiest to implement, since it doesnâ€™t require the construction of a tree. 
Since this algorithm works bottom up without rechecking any nodes,
it is typically using a recursive function and a function that checks if the game is over.
